## What is Ethics ?

- Rules to follow in a community to live in harmony
- Unwritten rules
- Confront yourself with questions
- Ethics help to control and manage science improvements

## Socrates

- Ancient Greek philosopher.

- Dialogues -> cave

- Only Greek philosopher who was sentenced to death. He accepted it and followed the law.

### Methods

- He tried to establish **Philosophy** as an alternative to the teaching of the **Sophists**.

> Sophists wanted to help people become successful by being good at persuading others.

### Basic concepts of ethics

- Most important quote:

  > "I know that I don't know"

- Western Philosophy focuses on doubt and argumentation: "**critical thinking**"

- There are two version: rational **optimism** and rational **pessimism**

- Socrates is asking the experts, but they **cannot answer**. They can't justify or explain their '_know how_'

- He is asking the sophists, but they cannot **defend their idea** and can't answer Socrates questions

## Skepticism

When people are doubting, it leads to skepticism. Once people start to doubt that there is any truth at all, he asks:

> How can we take our own _insight_ that humans can't have true insights ?

This leads to self-contradiction in skepticism.

Skeptics think that their view or everyone's view is relative, it not relative but universally true. They think that it's true that their is no truth.

## Plato's concept of knowledge

Knowledge is a true justified belief:

> The two most basic concept of western philosophy are truth and justification.

Justification: A coherent systematic world view with a hierarchic unity of knowledge.

## Wisdom as Truth

- Socrated is famous for saying

  > Philosophy is learning how to die.

- We must get to know ourselves

- We do not know ourselves and follow emotions instead of **reasons**

- We react to the way how the world is here and know with our sense, but we can find out how the world really is with our reason

- Truth is knowing who you really are. You are true to your higher. This is authenticity and honesty, the opposite is **dishonesty**

- We must be willing to _know not to know_ to admit and learn from mistakes

  > Those who tell you that you are wrong, those who criticize you are your best friends. Socrates

- It's either you are always true or you have friends
