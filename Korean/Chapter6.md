## Time

### Structure

To give an hour in Korean you must use this structure:

[Hours with classic counting method] **시** [Minutes with sino counting method] **분**

**시** means hour and **분** means minutes.

Their is a difference between AM and PM but we didn't learn about this for now so to write 8PM (20h) will be written 8:00.

Also half an hour can be replaced by 반 instead of [삼십분.](삼십분..md)

### 오전(AM) / 오후(PM)

To separate morning and afternoon, the same system as in english is used with AM/PM.
The proper usage is 오전 for the morning and 오후 for the afternoon.
